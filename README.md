# MIS-Research

A lightweight, GitHub Pages–ready library for research notes and source files.

## Structure

- `index.html` — homepage for GitHub Pages
- `notes/html/` — HTML notes (browser readable)
- `notes/md/` — Markdown notes (browser readable)
- `sources/pdf/` — PDFs
- `sources/docx/` — Word documents
- `audio/` — exported NotebookLM audio files

## GitHub Pages

In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source → `Deploy from a branch` → Branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`.

## NotebookLM audio

NotebookLM audio can usually be downloaded as WAV from the web app (desktop or mobile web). Save files into `audio/` and add links to `index.html`.

If you want, I can generate a podcast RSS feed so you can subscribe in any podcast app.
